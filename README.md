## Introduction

Age-based versioning is determined based on the age of _something_ which increases incrementally every 1 month.

## Example (new concept)

**Sample case**: if you were born on `January 1, 2000`, your current age on `February 12, 2025`, will be `25` years and `2` months. So the form in Age-based Versioning is:

```
> v25.2                          # in the most concise form, or
> Self v25.2+01022025_01012000   # in full form | date format [DDMMYYYY]
```

The latest version will support release stages, for example cases: A software company x will launch their software on `May 25, 2025` and will go through several stages of release before becoming a `stable` version on `February 25, 2027`, the first `LTS` version on `May 25, 2028` and `EOL` for the first `LTS` version on `May 25, 2033`, example table:
